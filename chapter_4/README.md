<h1>Statements</h1>

JavaScript programs are nothing more than a sequence of statements to execute. By default, the JavaScript interpreter executes these statements one after another in the order they are written. Another way to “make something happen” is to alter this default order of execution, and JavaScript has a number of statements or control structures that do just this:</br>
<ul>
    <li>Conditionals are statements like if and switch that make the JavaScript interpreter execute or skip other statements depending on the value of an expression.
    </li>
    <li>Loops are statements like while and for that execute other statements repetitively.
    </li>
    <li>Jumps are statements like break, return, and throw that cause the interpreter to jump to another part of the program.
    </li>
</ul>

The sections that follow describe the various statements in JavaScript and explain their
syntax.</br>
