<h1>New Journey : Learning JavaScript</h1>

<p>This repository was created for didactic purposes only. Where I'm going to show each the topic to be addressed and my development as "Beginner" of this new programming language for me.</p>

<p>At final of each topic, one project will be done to consolidate the knwoledge learned.</p>

<p>I'm going to show all my journey in this new language and I hope one day this repository can be used by Beginners and future enthusiasts of Js (JavaScript) as base to give your first steps in this language.</p>

<h2>Devices and Tecnologies</h2>

<p>For this journey I'm going to use a Smartphone and Termux (app - as linux but in device). If you have a computer Your experience will be more intereting and complete.</p>

<h3>Computer 💻</h3>

<p>If you are using computer device to learn JavaScript you have to install this tecnologies:</br>
<ul>
    <li>A Browser (Firefox, Opera Mini, etc but I recommend to use Chrome</li>
    <li>A Text/code editor - I hightly recommend Visual Studio Code (VS code)</li>
    <li>A Nodejs</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Smartphone 📱</h3>

<p>If you don't have money yet to buy a computer as me 😅, don't worry you can also learn JS without a computer, but play attention, don't make excuses or limite your self because you don't have a computer. Don't give up, work harder and don't let this limite your path to the knowledge.</p>

<p>For this <i>New Journey</i> I'm going to use a smartphone as main device, and the tecnologies to be installed are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Termux (the linux enviropment in Android or IOS device)</li>
    <li>Text/code editor (Vim or Nano, I recommend to use Vim)</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>

<p>Install the Termux and then install the package vim or nano and at the end the Node.js inside the termux enviropment</p>
