<h1>Array</h1>

<p>An <strong>Array</strong> is an ordered collection of values. Each value is called an element, and each element has a numeric position in the array, known as its index. The index of the first element is zero (0).</p>

<p>An array element may be of any type, and different elements of the same array may be of different types. Array elements may even be objects or other arrays, which allows you to create complex data structures, such as arrays of objects and arrays of arrays.</p>

<p>At this chapter we'll discuss about Array as you can see.</p>
